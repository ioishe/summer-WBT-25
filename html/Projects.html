        <h2>BICYCLE RENT MANAGEMENT</h2>
        <p>In a bicycle management system many rider may rent a bicycle. One bicycle may be rented by exactly one rider. A rider is identified by an unique user id. The system also stores rider name, rider age, rider address, rider phone number and rider type. A rider address is composed of house number, street name, city. A bicycle is identified by the unique property bicycle id. Type, condition and status are also stored.  While renting, the date of renting, rental id, rental duration, date of rental, return time, rental cost of the bicycle are stored. A rider make payment for each rent. Payment has payment amount, payment status, payment date, payment time, payment method and the unique property payment id. To identify a location the system stores location id, location name, location coordinates. Every maintenance record has maintenance date, maintenance type and maintenance number.

        <h2>Time-Scheduled Water Pump Control Using Arduino and DS3231 RTC Module </h2>
        <p>This project presents the design and implementation of an automated water pump control system utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, and a single-channel relay. The core functionality of the system is to automate the operation of a water pump based on predefined start and stop times. These times are stored and accurately tracked by the DS3231 RTC, which ensures precise scheduling regardless of power interruptions. An LCD display is integrated into the system to show the current time, date, and pump status, allowing users to monitor system activity in real-time.

        <h2>Traffic Light System Using 555 Timer IC</h2>
        <p> The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a traffic light control system using a 555 timer IC to simulate the operation of a real-world traffic signal. The project aims to:
Demonstrate the functionality of a 555 timer IC in generating precise timing sequences for traffic light transitions.
Provide a cost-effective and simple solution for understanding basic traffic light control mechanisms.
Simulate the sequential operation of traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green) to manage traffic flow efficiently.
Serve as an educational tool to learn about electronic circuit design, timing circuits, and their applications in real-life systems.
By achieving these objectives, the project will showcase the practical use of the 555 timer IC in creating a functional and scalable traffic light system.
